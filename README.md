# Feature Learning with Matrix Factorization and Neural Networks

A major step in most predictive analytics workflows is to create features from input data that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. This is often a manual and labor-intensive effort. Feature learning (also known as representation learning) allows important features to be automatically extracted from raw input data.

Topics that are covered:

* Manual feature engineering vs. feature learning
* Example applications of feature learning
* Matrix factorization approaches (deep dive into PCA/SVD)
* Neural network approaches (deep dive into Autoencoders and Skip-Gram/Word2Vec)
* Code samples using scikit-learn and keras

The make-data.ipynb does NOT need to be run, the feature-learning.ipynb pulls a pre-processed dataset from S3.
